      a 33yo deep thinker, deep feeler &amp; huge reader. perpetually hot. married w/o kids. more witty than funny. in love with throne of glass. an only child. always burning a candle. crazy about puppies, red wine, fall leaves &amp; my husband. obsessed with words—where they came from, how they’re used, what they mean. passionate about transformation and helping people experience the life they truly seek. re-losing the same 20 pounds I’ve lost 67 times before. and, learning to make peace with all of these things.
