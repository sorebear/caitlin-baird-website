         We all want to live our best possible life.  People envision healthy relationships, satisfying work and inner peace but often experience a gap between reality and these ideals. We may hold our circumstances, loved ones or culture at large responsible for this disparity. But, I believe the solution to this gap starts with us. Making sense of our lives often begins with making sense of ourselves.

         I have walked—and continue to walk—this path for almost a decade. Through self-reflection, spiritual direction, counseling, stable relationships and healthy doses of red wine I have experienced growth and healing where all hope seemed lost. You won't find simple answers here, but what you will find—depth, struggle, meaning, community —will ease the side effects of the chaos and help you to craft a life worth living. You can have the life you want.
